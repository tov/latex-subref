The subref Package

SYNOPSIS

    This package provides macros for referring to nested references. I
    use this when I have a theorem with multiple parts in order to
    attach labels to each part that refer to both the theorem number and
    the part number.

BUILDING

    To build the PDF documentation and style file, merely run

        % make

    If you don't have make, it's possible to do it manually.  To create
    the style file (subref.sty) and the documentation (subref.pdf), run
    the following sequence of commands:

        latex subref.ins
        latex subref.dtx
        makeindex -s gind.ist subref.idx
        makeindex -s gglo.ist -o subref.gls subref.glo
        latex subref.dtx
        pdflatex subref.dtx

    If you only want to build the style file, and not the documentation,
    only the first command (latex subref.ins) is necessary.

    The documentation is also available on the web at
